# **Equipment Vibration Monitoring** 

  > Monitor equipment vibrations. Get an alert when vibration exceeds a limit.



## Overview

Equipment vibration monitoring is a process of monitoring the vibration of equipment to detect any abnormality in the equipment. This can be used to detect any potential failure in the equipment. Vibration monitoring  is a critical part of predictive maintenance. It is used to detect the onset of a fault in a machine or equipment before it causes a failure. Vibration monitoring is a critical part of predictive maintenance. 

## Vision AI-based monitoring 

Vision AI-based model for monitoring equipment vibrations would be detecting the vibration of equipment and alerting the user if the vibration exceeds a limit. This can be used to detect any potential failure in the equipment.          



## Model
We would be releasing the model for monitoring equipment vibrations in *Q2-2023*.
