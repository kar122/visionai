# **Equipment Noise Monitoring** 

  > Monitor equipment noise levels. Get an alert when noise exceeds a limit.



## Overview

Equipment noise monitoring is a process of monitoring the noise levels of equipment to detect any abnormality in the equipment. This can be used to detect any potential failure in the equipment. Noise monitoring  is a critical part of predictive maintenance. It is used to detect the onset of a fault in a machine or equipment before it causes a failure. Noise monitoring is a critical part of predictive maintenance.

## Vision AI-based monitoring 

Vision AI-based model for monitoring equipment noise levels would be detecting the noise levels of equipment and alerting the user if the noise exceeds a limit. This can be used to detect any potential failure in the equipment.


## Model
We would be releasing the model for monitoring equipment noise levels in *Q2-2023*.
